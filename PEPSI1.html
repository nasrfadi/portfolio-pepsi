    <p> The Pepsi Refresh Project (PRP) was a 2010 initiative by PepsiCo to award $20 million in grants to individuals, businesses and non-profits that promote a new idea that has a positive impact on their community, state, or the nation. The project is completely separate from the Pepsi Corporate Foundation and uses money budgeted for marketing.

    </br> More than 80 million votes were registered and, at its peak, 37% of Americans were aware of the Refresh Project.
        
        This project has been the focus of a 2013 Harvard Business School case ("The Pepsi Refresh Project: a Thirst for Change"), describing the process that Pepsi's marketing team, led by senior marketing director Ana Maria Irazabal, went through to come up with this idea.</br>
        
        In early 2012, Pepsi abandoned the Refresh Project.</br> One opinion is due to declining market share and falling to third place behind Coke and Diet Coke.</p>
